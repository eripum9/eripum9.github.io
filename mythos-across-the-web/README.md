MythOS: Across the Web
======================

This is the subsite for the game "MythOS: Across the Web" and replaces the old Pixel Haunt demo.

Preview locally (PowerShell):

```pwsh
cd Website\mythos-across-the-web
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/mythos-across-the-web/
```

Notes:
- Update `index.html` to add screenshots or downloads.
- If you want this integrated into the main site navigation, I can add a link on the home page.
